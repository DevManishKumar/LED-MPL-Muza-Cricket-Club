                <h5><strong>Tournament: Rules, Registration and Procedure</strong></h5>
                   <P><strong>When:</strong> Dec 28th to Jan 4th</p>
                    <p><strong>Time:</strong> 11:00 to 3:00 PM</p>
                    <p><strong>Where:</strong> Muza Cricket Stadium</p>
                    
                    <ul><li>Registration Procedure</li>
                    <li>Rules</li>
                    <li>Tournament Procedure</li></ul>
                    <h5><b>Registration Procedure:</b></h5>
                    <p>Every team can have a maximum of 15 players, and must have a minimum of 11 players. Only up to 11 players will be playing during any one game, so 11 is required. Four extra players is recommended, since this is a tournament and one team can be playing only one times.</p>
                    <p>I need detailed information of only the Captain, e.g. Telephone or Cell phone number, email address, place of residence. The Captain shall provide names of players belonging to that team.</p>
                    <h5><b>Tournament Rules:</b></h5>
                       <p>Whatever I can so far think of is this:</p>
                        <ol>
                        <li>During the tournament all participants are expected to behave professionally and should avoid abusive language/gestures/ question umpiresï¿½ decisions. The participants must also remember to treat other players with respect as well as have fun.</li>
                        <ul><li>>There is a severe penalty for anyone who curses an opponent. That person will be removed from the whole tournament. No EXCUSES. If three players from a single team are removed, the entire team is banned. The team and Captain must make sure this does not happen.</li>
                        <li>>Cursing is constituted as abusive, hateful, or malignant language or behavior.</li></ul>
                        <li>The Team Captain is responsible for informing all of the teammates about when the team will be playing and on what dates. Our responsibility is to tell the Captain when his team will be playing.</li>
                        <li>At no account is PSA held accountable for any injuries happening during a game.</li>
                        <li>If any player is deemed to be violent, ill-cooperative, or dangerous to anyone around him, he will be removed, and possibly a police report will be filed.</li>
                        <li>Rule Update (3/13/06): In the case of a tie in a match where runs both teams scored are the same, the deciding factor of who wins will be decided by comparing the run rate of each team. If the run rate of both teams are the same, the deciding factor will be a bowl out. Both teams will select 5 bowlers. Each bowler will be given two tries to try to hit the wicket without a batter's presence. Victory of the match will proceed to whichever team is able to score the most wickets.</li>
                        <li> Rule Update (9/18/06) During bowling your arm must be completely straight, zero degrees of bending is allowed,  any noticeable bending of the arm will result in being called a 'no ball' and three or most of such deliveries will result in loss of bowling privilege.</li>
                        <li>Rule Update (9/18/06) Minimum eight player and maximum eleven players, a written list must be presented at the time of the coin toss NO SUBSTITUTION ALLOWED</li></ol>
                        <h5><b>Tournament Procedures:</b></h5>
                            <p>As of now, a total of eight (8) teams can play. Each team must lose one match in the tournament to be eliminated. Each match shall consist of one game of 20-overs (tentative) for both sides. There will be two brackets of games going on, the Winner's Bracket and the Loser's Bracket. All teams will start playing in the Winner's Bracket. As each team loses, they will be sent off to the Loser's Bracket. The round the team played before losing will be taken in consideration in placement in the Loser's Bracket.</p>
                            
                            <p>Teams will be paired up against each other in random order in the first round. Each team will compete against another team in a match. The winning team of the match will go on to the second round. The losing team will be sent off to the Loser's Bracket. The same procedure will happen again in the second round and the third round, each time the teams competing to go on to the next round. The third round will have only two teams in a face-off for the Finals.</p>
